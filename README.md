# Charter for XR Data Classification Working Group
# XR Safety Initiative
# Data Classification Framework Public Working Group

# Purpose

The purpose of XRSI Data Classification Framework Public Working Group (DCF-PWG) is to develop fundamental understanding of properties and classification of data in XR environments. The XR Data Classification Framework will identify practices and models currently implemented by global first movers and early adopters, examine how the implementation of these schemes can simplify XR enablement. The framework will help organizations and XR stakeholders in making pragmatic risk based decisions during the entire Data lifecycle.

DCF-PWG efforts will be directed to categorize specific types of data (and currently available mechanisms) needed for data classification scheme.  Corresponding security provisions can be applied based on the proposed classification scheme, enabling safer XR environments.
